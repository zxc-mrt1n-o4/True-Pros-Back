# Railway Deployment Fix for Supabase Realtime Issues

## Problem
Getting error: `"Realtime was unable to connect to the project database"` when deployed on Railway.

## Root Causes
1. **Supabase Realtime not enabled** in project settings
2. **Row Level Security (RLS)** blocking realtime subscriptions
3. **Network/firewall issues** between Railway and Supabase
4. **Authentication issues** with service role key
5. **Realtime configuration** not optimized for production

## Complete Fix

### 1. Supabase Project Configuration

#### Enable Realtime
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `qxncspwcibltnynmlivo`
3. Navigate to **Database** ‚Üí **Replication**
4. Find the `callback_requests` table
5. **Enable realtime** for this table by toggling the switch

#### Configure Row Level Security (RLS)
```sql
-- Connect to your Supabase SQL Editor and run:

-- 1. Enable RLS on callback_requests table
ALTER TABLE callback_requests ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2. Create policy for service role to access all rows
CREATE POLICY "Service role can access all callback_requests" 
ON callback_requests 
FOR ALL 
TO service_role 
USING (true) 
WITH CHECK (true);

-- 3. Allow realtime subscriptions for service role
CREATE POLICY "Service role can subscribe to realtime" 
ON callback_requests 
FOR SELECT 
TO service_role 
USING (true);

-- 4. Verify policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'callback_requests';
```

### 2. Railway Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in your Railway project:

```env
# Core Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=https://qxncspwcibltnynmlivo.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InF4bmNzcHdjaWJsdG55bm1saXZvIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MjAwMjE2MSwiZXhwIjoyMDU3NTc4MTYxfQ.mvE0PRDT_usHZ7NpuiAXYF-XB_p8_GE25kyCyaipFtY

```

### 3. Code Updates Applied

#### Enhanced Supabase Configuration
- Added realtime-specific connection parameters
- Implemented exponential backoff for reconnections
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Enhanced connection monitoring

#### Improved Realtime Service
- Pre-connection realtime capability testing
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Enhanced health monitoring every 5 minutes
- Better error categorization and handling
- Graceful degradation on connection failures

### 4. Deployment Steps

1. **Update Railway Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # In Railway dashboard, set all environment variables from step 2
   ```

2. **Deploy Updated Code**
   ```bash
   # Your code is already updated with the fixes
   # Just trigger a new deployment in Railway
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Check logs in Railway dashboard
   # Look for these success messages:
   # ‚úÖ Supabase connection successful
   # ‚úÖ Realtime capabilities confirmed
   # ‚úÖ Successfully subscribed to callback_requests changes
   ```

### 5. Testing and Monitoring

#### Health Check Endpoints
```bash
# Check overall health
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/health

# Check realtime status
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/realtime/status

# Test realtime connection
curl -X POST https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/realtime/test

# Manual reconnect if needed
curl -X POST https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/realtime/reconnect
```

#### Log Monitoring
Watch for these key log messages:
- `‚úÖ Realtime capabilities confirmed` - Initial connection successful
- `‚úÖ Successfully subscribed to callback_requests changes` - Subscription active
- `üíö Health check: connected` - Ongoing health monitoring
- `üîÑ Reconnection attempt` - Automatic recovery in progress

### 6. Troubleshooting

#### If Still Getting Database Connection Error:

1. **Check Supabase Project Status**
   - Ensure project is not paused/sleeping
   - Verify billing is up to date
   - Check Supabase status page

2. **Verify Service Role Key**
   ```bash
   # Test the service role key manually
   curl -X GET 'https://qxncspwcibltnynmlivo.supabase.co/rest/v1/callback_requests?select=count' \
   -H "apikey: YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
   ```

3. **Check Network Connectivity**
   ```bash
   # From Railway logs, verify DNS resolution
   nslookup qxncspwcibltnynmlivo.supabase.co
   ```

4. **Enable Debug Logging**
   Add to Railway environment variables:
   ```env
   DEBUG=supabase*
   LOG_LEVEL=debug
   ```

#### If Realtime Works Initially Then Stops:

1. **Check Connection Limits**
   - Supabase free tier has connection limits
   - Monitor concurrent connections

2. **Review Health Monitoring**
   - Check logs for health check failures
   - Look for automatic reconnection attempts

3. **Manual Recovery**
   ```bash
   # Trigger manual reconnection
   curl -X POST https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/realtime/reconnect
   ```

### 7. Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Startup Sequence:**
   ```
   üîç Testing Supabase connection...
   ‚úÖ Supabase connection successful
   üß™ Testing realtime capabilities...
   ‚úÖ Realtime capabilities confirmed
   üì° Realtime subscription status: SUBSCRIBED
   ‚úÖ Successfully subscribed to callback_requests changes
   üè• Starting enhanced realtime health monitoring...
   ```

2. **Ongoing Operation:**
   ```
   üíö Health check: connected | Last activity: 45s
   üÜï New callback request: [callback-id]
   ‚úÖ Notification sent for new callback: [callback-id]
   ```

3. **Automatic Recovery:**
   ```
   ‚ùå Realtime channel error: [error]
   üîÑ Scheduling reconnection attempt 1/5 in 1000ms...
   üîÑ Reconnection attempt 1/5
   ‚úÖ Successfully subscribed to callback_requests changes
   ```

### 8. Monitoring Dashboard

Access these URLs to monitor your deployment:
- Health: `https://your-railway-url.railway.app/health`
- Realtime Status: `https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/realtime/status`
- Manual Controls: `https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/realtime/test`

The system now includes comprehensive error handling, automatic reconnection, and health monitoring to ensure reliable realtime functionality in production.
